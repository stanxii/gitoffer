					  <section className="section-block">
						<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated: September 9, 2015</p>
						<p>
						  GreateJob, Inc. ("GreateJob") has drafted its Privacy Policy to ensure that you can clearly understand our data and security practices and policies as you use GreateJob's websites and software applications (the "Sites"). This Privacy Policy describes the types of Personal Information we collect, how we use the information, with whom we share it, and the choices you can make about our collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information. The phrase "Personal Information" refers to information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number or other billing information. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of your Personal Information and how you can contact us about our privacy practices.
						</p>
						<p>
						  This Privacy Policy incorporates by reference the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.greatejob.com/term">Terms Of Use</a>  for the Sites, which apply to this Privacy Policy. When you visit the Sites or provide us with information, you consent to our use and disclosure of the information we collect or receive, as described in this Privacy Policy, unless separate terms are offered by you in writing and accepted in writing by GreateJob.
						</p>
						<p>
						  Please review this Privacy Policy periodically, as we may update it from time to time without prior notice to reflect changes in our data practices. We will post a prominent notice on our Sites to notify you of any significant changes to our Privacy Policy and indicate at the bottom of the notice when it was most recently updated. If we make material changes to the policy that will affect previously collected Personal Information, you will be notified and asked to consent to the updated Privacy Policy when you visit our Sites.

						</ul>
						<p>When you upload your resume to the Sites, you will have the option to choose between the following 2 levels of privacy.</p>
						<p>
						  <strong>Option 1</strong> makes your resume discoverable in our resume database. By selecting this option, your resume and contact details (to the extent you provide them or include them in your resume) can be discovered and viewed by any registered employer user who posts jobs on the Sites. This setting enables you to be found by employers who are seeking candidates matching your background and experience for their open positions. We also may share Personal Information with our service providers who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you.
						</p>
						<p>
						  <strong>Option 2</strong> makes your resume private and hidden from our employer users, though you will still be able to use it to apply for jobs on the Sites. Please note that this setting only applies to whether or not your resume is visible to employers. GreateJob will still collect, use or disclose anonymous aggregate information about you and your visits in the manner described <a rel="nofollow" href="#information-share">below</a>. You may choose to remove your resume from our resume database at any time. However, you may still be contacted by employers or recruiters who retain a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.

						<h2>Information We Share</h2>
						<p>
						  When you apply for a job through the Sites or upload your resume to the Sites, employers will have access to information about you and your potential interest in employment opportunities. Those employers may use your information to contact you directly. Additionally, when you apply for a job through the Sites, the information supplied by you becomes part of the GreateJob database but also may become part of the employer's database. Similarly, if an employer downloads your resume, your resume may become a part of the employer's database. In these instances, the use of such information by the employer will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and we are not responsible for that company's use of your information.
						</p>
						<p>
						  The Sites may track the total number of visitors to our Sites, the number of visitors to each page of our Sites, IP addresses, External Web Sites linked to, search terms and the domain names of our users' Internet Service Providers, operating system and browser type, and we may analyze these data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We also may collect aggregate information such as demographics including age, occupation, gender, salary information and labor statistics. Such aggregate information may be collected from data that you have provided to us via usage of the Sites and/or public records, and is not unique to you nor is it linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We may share this aggregate information with third parties, including for various reasons related to our business to assist them in targeting advertisements to appropriate audiences.
						</p>
						<p>
						  Other than instances in which users opt to publicly post their Personal Information to our resume database, provide it via a job application, include it in a job posting or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users' Personal Information to anyone for any reason. When posting jobs and resumes, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display.
						</p>
						<p>
						  We share Personal Information with our service providers who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law.
						</p>
						<p>GreateJob also may disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of GreateJob or other users of the Sites.</p>
						<p>In addition, Personal Information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, a bankruptcy, or another corporate reorganization of GreateJob.</p>

						<h2>About Cookies, Tracking Choices, and Third Party Advertisers</h2>
						<p>By using our Sites, you consent to GreateJob's policies and practices concerning Cookies, Tracking Choices, and Third Party Advertisers, as follows:</p>
						<p>
						  A "cookie" is a text file that websites send to a visitor‘s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A "Web beacon" can also be called a Web bug, a pixel tag or a clear GIF. Used in combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a website or in an email and used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the website or receiving the email.
						</p>
						<p>
						  Other than instances in which users opt to publicly post their Personal Information to our resume database, provide it via a job application, include it in a job posting or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users' Personal Information to anyone for any reason. When posting jobs and resumes, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display.
						</p>
						<p>
						  GreateJob uses cookies, and other similar technologies, for the convenience of our users. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. GreateJob also uses cookies placed on your computer to store non-personally identifying information about you, such as past jobs viewed and job searches conducted on your computer. We do this in order to present you with job recommendations based on your interests, as expressed previously through your searches.
						</p>
						<p>
						  GreateJob uses cookies to ensure the proper functioning and efficiency of our Sites. Most web browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer's hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please be aware, however, that some GreateJob features or services may not function properly without cookies.
						</p>
						<p>
						  GreateJob permits third-party cookies on its Sites. For example, third-party tools located on the Sites, including those that allow for social media sharing, may use cookies to remember user preference settings. GreateJob also uses web analytics services provided by third parties, which use cookies to collect non-personal information about users' visits to the Sites (including IP addresses) and the resources they access on the Sites. These third-party web analytics services provide us with reports based on this non-personal information in order to help us understand how visitors engage with our Sites.  In addition, these third-party web analytics services may share aggregate data with third-party advertising companies to enable interest-based and retargeting advertising services.
						</p>
						<p>
						  GreateJob uses third-party advertising companies that may place or access cookies on your computer's hard drive to distinguish your web browser uniquely and keep track of information related to serving ads on your web browser, such as the types of ads shown and the web pages on which the ads appeared. These companies may use information about your visits to our Sites and to other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you on our Sites or on other, third-party sites. We may also allow third-party advertisers to tailor their advertisements on our Sites using demographic and preference information we provide to them in aggregate form. This information does not identify you individually.
						</p>
						<p>
						  The third-party advertising companies used by GreateJob operate under their own privacy policies and we encourage you to be aware of the privacy policies of such companies. GreateJob does not have control over or access to any information contained in the cookies that are set on your computer by third-party advertisers.
						</p>
						<p>
						  Our Sites do not respond to web browser "do not track" signals. However, to help prevent and limit the automatic collection of information by any participating third-party advertisers, including the collection of personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, you may opt-out of such collection by clicking the AdChoices icon located within the ad, by accessing the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" rel="nofollow">"about ads" opt-out site</a>, or by accessing the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" rel="nofollow">NAI opt-out site</a>. Please note that this opt-out is cookie-based. If you buy a new computer, change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to perform each opt-out task again.
						</p>
						<p>
						  In addition, some employers using our Sites may place cookies on your computer through their job postings and may use such cookies to distinguish your web browser uniquely. Often, employers use such information to track the effectiveness of their job postings by measuring how many users who view their postings later become job applicants.
						</p>
						<p>
						  Finally, GreateJob has enabled the Remarketing Lists feature of Google Analytics Advertising Features. Together, GreateJob and Google use both first-party and third-party cookies to serve customized ads to you based on your past visits to our Sites. This means that GreateJob promotional material might appear on a variety of other websites you visit across the web.
						</p>
						<p>
						  You may opt-out of Google Analytics Advertising Features by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/" rel="nofollow">Google Ads Preferences Manager</a>. To prevent your web usage data from being used by Google Analytics, you may also download and install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" rel="nofollow">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a>.
